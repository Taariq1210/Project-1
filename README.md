# Project-1

## Overview

I have been tasked to create an application that will utilise some supporting tools, methods and technologies that includes all fundamental modules covered in the training.

I will be using the language from the programming fundamentals module, which will interact with the managed database.

I will plan how I will approach this project using design techniques learnt and will create a CI pipeling that can automate deployment of my project.
